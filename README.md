# multi-regional-sales-performance-analysis
An end-to-end sales performance analysis project leveraging Excel, Power Query, Google Sheets, BigQuery (SQL), and Tableau to uncover revenue drivers, regional growth patterns, and strategic market insights.

 # Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end sales performance analysis of a multi-regional manufacturing dataset spanning 2022–2025.

The objective was to identify the key drivers of revenue growth, evaluate regional performance patterns, and assess whether revenue expansion was driven by volume growth or value optimization strategies.

The dataset was anonymized for confidentiality purposes. The analysis reflects a real-world business intelligence workflow from raw data processing to executive dashboard delivery.


 # Business Objectives

The analysis was designed to answer the following business questions:
	1.	Is revenue growth driven by increased sales volume?
	2.	Which regions contribute most to overall performance?
	3.	How significant is the export market in overall growth?
	4.	Which product groups drive the highest revenue?
	5.	How has performance evolved over time?



# Tools & Technologies Used
	•	Microsoft Excel – Initial data inspection and structure validation
	•	Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
	•	Google Sheets – Structured formatting, cleaning, and upload preparation
	•	BigQuery (SQL) – Data modeling, aggregation, KPI computation, and analytical views
	•	Tableau – Interactive dashboard design and executive reporting



# Data Workflow
	1.	Raw sales data reviewed and structured in Excel
	2.	Data cleaned and transformed using Power Query
	3.	Dataset prepared and uploaded via Google Sheets
	4.	Analytical views built in BigQuery using SQL
	5.	KPIs and performance metrics modeled in cloud data warehouse
	6.	Final insights visualized in Tableau dashboard

This workflow mirrors a modern BI pipeline using cloud-based analytics infrastructure.



# Key Insights
	•	Revenue growth outpaced modest volume fluctuations, suggesting value-based expansion rather than pure unit growth.
	•	The South-West region dominates domestic sales performance.
	•	The export market (Abidjan) is a fast-growing segment contributing to an increasing revenue share.
	•	Product performance varies significantly, with certain product groups driving disproportionate revenue impact.
	•	Geographic concentration indicates opportunities for regional optimization and expansion.
